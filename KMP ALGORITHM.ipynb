    "# KMP ALGORITHM\n",
    "**Knuth-Morris-Pratt** algorithm searches for occurences of a *word*\n",
    "within a main *text string* using  degenerating property (pattern having same sub-patterns apperaring more than once in a pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst case complexity to **O(n)**, where **n** represents the text size. Without using the KMP algorithm and using a \"naive\" approach, in which the pattern is slided one by one and compared to all text characters at each shift, the performance would be **O(nm)** (m represents the pattern size). The key of this algorithm is to preprocess the pattern, computing a \"*Partial match table*\". This table indicate a \"phase displacement\", i.e the next position in which it can be found a potential occurrence of the pattern. Next step is string matching: when a mismatch is found, the partial match table is considered to continue the research avoiding the reset of the string index. The whole algorithm is based on the longest proper prefix which is also suffix. A proper prefix is one with whole string not allowed. For example, whereas prefixes of \"ABC\" are \" \", \"A\", \"AB\", \"ABC\", proper prefixes are \" \", \"A\" and \"AB\". Proepr suffixes are \" \", \"C\", \"BC\".\n",

    "## Partial Match Table\n",
    "\n",
    "1. KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern and build and auxilary `PMT[]` of `len(pat)` which is used to skip characters while matching\n",
    "2. Longest proper prefixes which are also suffixes are searched in sub-patterns. \n",
    "3. For each sub-pattern, the PMT table stores length of the maximum matching proper prefix which is also a suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This step provides several passages: \n",
    "1. The comparison starts considering `pat[patindex]` with `patindex = 0`.\n",
    "2. The algorithm keep comparing `txt[txtindex]` and `pat[patindex]`and  increments *txtindex* and *patindex* when a match is found.\n",
    "3. When a mismatch is found:<br>\n",
    "    3.1. Characters `pat[0...patindex-1]` match with`txt[txtindex-patindex...txtindex-1]`.<br>\n",
    "    3.2 `PMT[patindex-1]` is count of characters of `pat[0...patindex-1]`,both prefixes and suffixes.<br>\n",
    "    3.3 As now,`PMT[patindex-1]` characters don't need to be matched with`txt[txtindex-patindex...txtindex-1]` since these             characters will match anyway.\n"
